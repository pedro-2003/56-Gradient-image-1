"""Candidate selection and plateau detection on measured statistics.

Two problems, both created by the evaluator's structure:

1. Selection noise. The holdout screen uses 1 of the evaluator's 16 noise draws
   per stratum; the argmin over many candidates of a noisy estimate is biased
   toward lucky candidates (winner's curse). Fix: race — screen every
   candidate cheaply, confirm the top few with more draws, and pick with a
   one-standard-error rule using *paired* differences (same noise draws for
   both candidates, so the SE is the SE of the difference, not of the levels).

2. Plateau. Training past the holdout optimum wastes the rest of the budget
   (50-90% in the current champion's own runs). Fix: declare a plateau when
   recent screens fail to beat the best by more than the paired SE, so the
   controller can spend the remaining budget on something that still helps.

No constant here is tuned on a dataset: the SE is measured from the screen's
own per-case losses, and the small integers (top-k, window) are counts.
