"""Evaluator twin: score candidate LoRA states through the evaluator's own code path.

Why. On two families the numbers the evaluator computes differ from what our
training hook computes, no matter how careful the hook is:
  - ideogram4: the evaluator loads a per-tensor `comfy_quant` fp8 file (not the
    per-row copy in the task cache), merges the LoRA with stochastic rounding
    seeded by crc32(key), and runs fp8 activations through `_scaled_mm`;
  - qwen-image: same file as training, but the merge is stochastic rounding to
    plain fp8, not round-to-nearest.
Rather than re-implementing those numerics, the twin *is* the evaluator in
process: the base is loaded the way `image_artifacts.prepare_base` loads it,
each candidate is applied with `comfy.sd.load_lora_for_models` (what
`nodes.LoraLoader` calls), and the forward runs under `CFGGuider.sample`
exactly as `evaluators/diffusion.py` does. The candidate is exported to the same
tensor dict we would upload, so a key the evaluator cannot match is caught here.

Cost: a second model resident (ideogram4 9.3 GB fp8, qwen-image 20 GB fp8) and
a patch/unpatch per scored candidate. Used for the confirm stage only.
